Application Plan


Purpose of Application: 

The application enables 3 users to draw a collaborative sketch together. Each user has to login using their password and email address. When the user signs in they can choose to participate in a collaborative drawing or visit the gallery to see all the drawings they have participated in. Each user does not know the other person they drew the drawing with. 

Technology used: 

- HTML and CSS to basic website setup
- JavaScript for interactivity of website such as drawing part. Will probably use an interactive canvas from a library
- SQL for database which will hold username, password and drawings the user participated in as well as partial drawings which will be combined to a full drawing once each user is done
- NodeJS for server interactions so that 3 users can use the application simultaneously
