## Application Plan


### Purpose of Application: 

The application enables 3 users to draw a collaborative sketch together. Each user has to login using their password and email address. When the user signs in they can choose to participate in a collaborative drawing or visit the gallery to see all the drawings they have participated in. Each user does not know the other person they drew the drawing with. 

---

### Technology used: 
- HTML and CSS to basic website setup
- JavaScript for interactivity of website such as drawing part. Will probably use an interactive canvas from a library
- SQL for database which will hold username, password and drawings the user participated in as well as partial drawings which will be combined to a full drawing once each user is done
- NodeJS for server interactions so that 3 users can use the application simultaneously

|----------|:--------|
| HTML CSS: Basic Setup     | I started creating the HTML and CSS files in order to get a better idea how I would like to structure the app |
| JavaScript: Canvas | I decided to use a flexbox in order to structure the elements betters for resizing of the website and to make it compatible for different devices|
||The canvas will have an image background to create the illusion of a folded piece of paper, while the user can only draw on a third of it. The other 2 thirds of the paper will be drawn on by two other users |
|| I want to use the JS library Konva in order to implement the canvas drawing feature https://konvajs.org/docs/index.html|
