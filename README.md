# SketchQuisite

SketchQuisite is a reworked project from the final project I created for CART 351. I decided to finish this project since I 
wrote the initial code with a lot of help by my professor and was partially unable to achieve certain stylistic aspects due 
to the lack of experience. I used the previous project as a guideline in what I want to achieve and create all the project components myself. The detailled process description of this project can be found in the Process folder.
